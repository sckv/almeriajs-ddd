This project is a very basic example following the Domain Driven Design conventions for the code and services planning.

# Installation

To try the repo you need `yarn` and `docker` installed. Both of them are obligatorily needed.

```bash
$ yarn install
$ docker-compose up
```

PS: I do not encourage making this project a production ready example, it is a very basic and oversimplified. To make this project production-ready a lot of conceptual work and coding needs to be done, with polished concepts of DDD principles and deep expertise with the domain experts of the topic, modelling and quite a lot of code vital refactorings.
